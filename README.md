# Hamming Code 

This repository contains an implementation of the Hamming Code algorithm in Rust. Hamming Code is an error-correcting code that can detect and correct single-bit errors in data transmission.

## Features
- Encoding of data using Hamming Code
- Decoding of Hamming Code with error correction
- Example usage demonstrating encoding and decoding

## Usage
To use the Hamming Code implementation, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hamming-code.git
   cd hamming-code
   ```
2. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. Run the example:
   ```bash
   cargo run --example hamming_code_example
   ```
